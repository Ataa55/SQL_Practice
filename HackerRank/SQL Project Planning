You are given a table, Projects, containing three columns: Task_ID, Start_Date and End_Date. It is guaranteed that the difference between the End_Date and the Start_Date is equal to 1 day for each row in the table.

If the End_Date of the tasks are consecutive, then they are part of the same project. Samantha is interested in finding the total number of different projects completed.

Write a query to output the start and end dates of projects listed by the number of days it took to complete the project in ascending order. If there is more than one project that have the same number of completion days, then order by the start date of the project.
**************************************
for end_date, if any two end_dates are consecutive >> then they are at the same project
order by
1- number of days
2- start  date
we know th projects start dates as: they aren't at the end_date col
we know th projects end dates as: they aren't at the start_date col
**************************************************************
--select projects ranked start dates
with start_cte as(
select start_date, rank() over(order by start_date) as rank_start
