##sol1

select 
      w.name,
      w.continent
from world w
where w.population > all (select 3*population from world x2 where w.continent = x2.continent
and w.name <> x2.name)

##sol2 (i think this soloution is more optimized, besouse there is no sub query within the where cndition)

select t.name, w.continent from(
select 
       w.name as name,
       count(*) as all_neighbours,
       sum(case
               when w.population > x.population *3
                   then 1
                   else 0
                end) as triple_neighbour

from world w
join (select * from world) x
on w.continent = x.continent 
and w.name <> x.name
group by w.name) as t
join world w
on w.name = t.name
where all_neighbours = triple_neighbour
order by name
